    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Blackened mahi mahi comes together in just minutes with an easy homemade
      seasoning blend and a few minutes under the broiler for a deliciously
      simple dinner.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>mahi mahi filets (fresh or frozen)</li>
      <li>
        blackening spices: smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, brown or
        coconut sugar, cayenne, salt, pepper, basil, oregano, parsley
      </li>
      <li>avocado oil spray</li>
      <li>lime wedges for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by preheating the broiler in the oven. The top rack should be
        positioned in the upper third of the oven.
      </li>
      <li>Pat the filets dry and lightly spray with the avocado oil.</li>
      <li>
        Mix the blackening spices together in a small bowl. Press the seasoning
        into the fish generously coating both sides of the filets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the mahi mahi in a baking dish and broil for about 10 minutes
        until cooked through and flaky.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the filets so start
        checking around the 7-8 minute mark. The flesh should easily flake apart
        when it's cooked through. Don't overcook as mahi mahi tends to get
        rubbery if cooked too long.
      </li>
    </ol>
