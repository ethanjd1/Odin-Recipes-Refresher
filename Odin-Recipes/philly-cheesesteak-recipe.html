    <p>
      This easy Philly Cheesesteak Recipe is the ultimate game day fare! Tender
      bites of sirloin, sautéed peppers and onions, and melted provolone cheese
      are all cooked up in one skillet and loaded on toasted hoagie rolls.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>STEAK: Strip steaks or boneless rib eyes work best.</li>
      <li>ONION</li>
      <li>BELL PEPPERS</li>
      <li>CHEESE</li>
      <li>ROLLS</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by giving the steak a quick marinade with olive oil, garlic, and
        balsamic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast the bell peppers until they're tender and have just a hint of
        caramelization.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the peppers roast, sauté the onions to develop golden color and
        sweet flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the peppers and onions are ready, sear the steak in a hot skillet
        until just cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the veggies to the pan and taste for seasoning, then layer the
        sliced cheese over the top and let it melt into the mixture. We stir it
        into the steak mixture once it melts, but you can leave it on top too.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toast the rolls lightly if you like, or leave them as is, then spoon in
        the filling and serve with steak fries or chips.
      </li>
    </ol>
